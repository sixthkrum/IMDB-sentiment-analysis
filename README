Uses TF-IDF, word embeddings and deep learning to do sentiment analysis on the IMDB reviews dataset.
Has a 87% accuracy. The inbuilt preprocessed IMDB reviews dataset from keras has a similar accuracy using the deep learning model in this project.

How to run:
--Start a python3 virtual environment and activate it.

--Install all requirements in requirements.txt.

--Put the train and test csv files in the root directory that is project is cloned into in folder 'train' and 'test'. The relative path should be like '../train'.

--Set userDefinedParameters.json according to what you want to run.
  "vocabSize": Sets vocab size
  "batch_size": Sets batch size for training
  "sequence_length": Sets sequence length for lstm
  "train": 1 if you want to train the model, 0 if not
  "model_name": name of model
  "num_of_epochs": number of epochs
  "processData": 1 if you want to process the data, 0 if not 
  "userTest": 1 if you want to test the output on a single review, 0 if not (supercedes everythin else)
